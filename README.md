# ECE-721-Proj-3_Superscalar_Processor_Pipeline_Simulator
This project extends a cycle-accurate superscalar RISC-V pipeline simulator (721sim) by completing missing pipeline components and integrating a previously developed register renaming module. The simulator models the canonical superscalar pipeline taught in ECE 721: Advanced Microarchitecture.
